# Analysis of waste data in Australia from 2016-2019
## Overview
With the growing concerns surrounding climate change, humanity, ranging from global to individual level needs to make an effort to meet sustainability goals set by world leaders. Analyzing how waste is treated and generated in Australia will provide insights that will help increase the efficiency of the process and allow us to work towards the goal.   
  
In this project, we sourced the waste data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the years 2016-2019 (which was the latest data available at the time of the project) and used PowerBi and employed the ETL process to analyze the dataset, extract insights, and produce visualizations.

## About the dataset
The Waste dataset is separated into 2 files, one containing data from 2016-2017 and the other from 2018-2019. Each file contains several tables which contains information pretaining different categories of waste and their generation and usage.
